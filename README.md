# Stat Arb

A statistical arbitrage research platform built with Next.js.

This project will be a browser-based environment for exploring mean-reversion strategies, cointegration analysis, and pairs trading across financial instruments. The goal is to make quantitative trading concepts tangible through interactive visualization rather than static textbook formulas.

## Planned

- Pairs identification through cointegration testing (Engle-Granger, Johansen)
- Spread visualization with Bollinger Bands and z-score overlays
- Backtest engine for mean-reversion entry/exit signals
- Historical performance attribution
- Risk metrics (Sharpe, max drawdown, win rate)

## Tech

Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4

## Status

Scaffolded and ready for implementation. Part of a quantitative finance toolkit alongside [monte-carlo](https://github.com/sisiphamus/monte-carlo), [black-scholes-lab](https://github.com/sisiphamus/black-scholes-lab), [plasma](https://github.com/sisiphamus/plasma), and [neutron](https://github.com/sisiphamus/neutron).
